Hello, my name is OtÃ¡vio and I am in career transition
I work with software sales and I have a degree in business administration. 
I intend to study software engineering and I'm starting my studies with html css and java with the first objective of being fullstack. 
I'm also interested in learning more about cybersecurity, sre, mobile and games.
I am always open to new opportunities, projects and friends. Let's code together?
